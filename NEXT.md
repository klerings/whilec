# Current Status (Working):
- declaration of simple tuples (test/tuples1.while)
- variables (SymExp) inside TupleExpressions (test/tuples3.while)
- access of tuples via # operator (test/tuples4.while)
- parsing of nested tuples (test/tuples2.while and test/tuples6.while)
- tuples with one element (test/tuples7.while)

# What is not working anymore
- tuple assignment of already declared tuples (test/tuples5.while)
